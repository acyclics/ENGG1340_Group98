  //step 1B: initial and generate testcase matrix
  //step 2: similiator (start global timer)
  //step 2A:setup cashiers and distribute customers to different cashiers in a period of time
  //step 2B: once the first customer reach the cashiers, start the timer for that cashier.
  //step 2C: for each occupied cashiers, once reached 15min, flush queue.
